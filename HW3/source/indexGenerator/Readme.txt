-------------------------------------------PRE-REQUISITES--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required software in system:
java development kit
version preferred: 1.8.0_101


Note : A directory with name docs should be created in the directory same as the source code to make text documents available
      for the program

-----------------------------------------------CODE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        ::::::::::::INDEXER:::::::::::::::
						
Purpose: Parsed text documents are used to generate inverted index 

Description: The text documents generated by text transformer are used here to generate index and other statistics of the corpus.

Design choice: The text documents are read and unigram, bigram and trigram words are generated and indexed into three separate indexes.
               I have choosen HashMap of java as my choice of data structure as it the most efficient when it comes searching and fetching.
               I am also sorting generated index alphabetically at the last using treeMap which can be ignored. But if we are going with java as the choice of programming language the HashMap is best suited to maintain the index.
               I am using java serialization to store index to disk which can be later read and used for searching.The code is currently commented.
               There are unknown symbols appearing in the index. This is because the text transformer retains nonenglish symbols like Hindi words or arabic words.
			   The index when reading the file and processing couldn't retain this, hence the symbols.
			   The program also stores document id and document name mapping in a file called filemap.text.

source file name: indexCreator.java

Execution steps:
----------------
step-1: copy all the text documents to be indexed into docs directory
step-2: launch command promt.
step-3: change current directory to source file directory 
step-4: To compile the code please use following command
		javac -d . indexCreator.java
step-5: To run the program use following command 
		java -cp . com.neu.indexCreator


Validation steps:
-----------------
Once the execution is complete,following documents will be generated.
