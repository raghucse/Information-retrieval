List 1 contains urls crawled using task1 code with seed as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy in the order they were crawled.
List 2 contains urls crawled using task1 code with seed as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power in the order they were crawled.
Combined list containes the merged url
url limit of combined list is 1000

Merging process for List 1 and List 2 with minimal loss of information 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The links that were crawled first, i.e the one which appeared at the shallower depth are more important.
Hence we iterate lists from top. 

1) Take fisrt url of List1 and remove it from List1. Add it to the end of combined list if it is not already present in it.
2) Take first url of List2 and remove it from List2. Add it to the end of combined list if it is not already present in combined list and size
   limit of combined list is not reached.
3) repeat Step:1 and step:2 until combined list url limit is reached. 
4) Combined list contains 1000 urls

Pseudo code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
while(combined-list.size()!=1000) //exit when list size limit is met
{
	url = List1.getFirst(); //get the first element and remove it from list 1
	if(!combined-list.contain(url)) //if the url is not already present in the combined-list
	{
	    combined-list.add(url);  // add the url to the end of list
	}
	
	
	url = List2.getFirst(); //get the first element and remove it from list 2
	if(!combined-list.contain(url) && combined-list.size()!=1000) //if the url is not already present in the combined-list and combined-list size limit has not reached
	{
	    combined-list.add(url); // add the url to the end of list
	}
}
