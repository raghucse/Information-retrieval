-------------------------------------------PRE-REQUISITES--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required software in system:
java development kit
version preferred: 1.8.0_101


Note: Place filemap.txt generated by indexFileGenerator.java in the same folder as source file.

Purpose: Rank the documents based on the generated cosine score for the respective query

Description: The program generates cosine for each docuements based on each term in the query

Design choice: The method used for tf-idf calculation for query and document is exaplained in detail report for implementation.
               The cosine score for query and document are calculated seperately here and they just multiplied later and added for each term in a 
			   query for the document. I those this way because I used the concept better through this calculation process. 
			   			   
			   
source file name: vectorSpaceRetriever.java

Execution steps:
----------------
step-1: launch command promt.
step-2: change current directory to source file directory 
step-3: To compile the code please use following command
		javac -d . vectorSpaceRetriever.java
		Ignore: warnings
step-4: To run the program use following command 
		java -cp . com.neu.vectorSpaceRetriever
step-5: you will prompted to provide the location of index file. 
        The one we generated using indexFileGenerator.java 
step-6: Once the index file is loaded into memory,
        you will be prompted for the file which has queries.
		Quries must be stored in the file in the following format,
		Query_Id;Query      
		 
Validation steps:
-----------------
Once the execution is complete,following documents will be generated.
