-------------------------------------------PRE-REQUISITES--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required software in system:
java development kit
version preferred: 1.8.0_101

                                  ::::::::::::INDEXER:::::::::::::::
						
Purpose: Parsed text documents are used to generate inverted index 

Description: The text documents generated by text transformer are used here to generate unigram index.

Design choice: The text documents are read and unigram words are generated and indexed
               I have choosen HashMap of java as my choice of data structure as it the most efficient when it comes searching and fetching.
               But if we are going with java as the choice of programming language the HashMap is best suited to maintain the index.
               I am using java serialization to store index to disk which can be later read and used for searching based on query.
			   The program also stores document id and document name mapping in a file called filemap.text.

source file name: indexFileGenerator.java

Execution steps:
----------------
step-1: launch command promt.
step-2: change current directory to source file directory 
step-3: To compile the code please use following command
		javac -d . indexFileGenerator.java
step-4: To run the program use following command 
		java -cp . com.neu.indexFileGenerator
step-5: you will prompted to provide the location of documents which are to be indexed.
        Provide absolute path of the directory and press enter


Validation steps:
-----------------
Once the execution is complete,following documents will be generated.
unigramtf.ser
filemap.txt
